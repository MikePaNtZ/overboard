# Senior Controls — working context

- **Worktree:** `~/projects/overboard-controls` (ADR-0006: one worktree per role, never share a working directory)
- **Registry:** [`docs/decisions/ROLES.md`](../../docs/decisions/ROLES.md)
- **Read first:** [`docs/decisions/INDEX.md`](../../docs/decisions/INDEX.md)

## Current sub-goals
- **Blocking the first public announcement:** re-run the sim with the imperfect-sensor profile.
  Every number marketing would publish today comes from a sim that knows its own tilt perfectly.
  The numbers will get worse; we must publish the honest ones first. Nobody told this role it
  was holding up a launch — that silence is the actual defect.
- Closed-loop control is in sim; the estimator closes the loop on the shuttle.

## Turf notes
- Owns `crates/`, `tests/`, `scripts/`, most of `sim/` — but **not** `sim/models/`,
  `sim/scenarios/plant.py` or `imperfections.py` (Mechanical: the fidelity contract).
- **Inside `sim/models/`:** `<sensor>` and `<actuator>` elements are yours and need no row.
  Mass, inertia, geometry, contact and friction are Mechanical's and do.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is yours. `.github/policy_check.py` and `CODEOWNERS` are the COO's.
